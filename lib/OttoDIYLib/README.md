This repository has the main [Otto DIY robot](https://www.ottodiy.com/) libraries for Arduino compatible boards.

## Compatible Hardware

- Designed to work mainly with Arduino Nano boards, but most of the code could be adapted to other microcontrollers.
- Arduino Nano family
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Micro
- Arduino Mega
- Arduino Mini
- Arduino Leonardo
- ESP8266
- ESP32 (in development)

:star: Star us on GitHub, it helps!

## Installation:

You will need the [Arduino IDE on your computer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
You can find this library in the Arduino Manager as `OttoDIYLib` by Otto DIY, for quick installation or manually:

1. [Download Otto DIY libraries here](https://github.com/OttoDIY/OttoDIYLib/archive/master.zip)
2. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...
3. Navigate to .zip file location that you just downloaded and open it.
4. You will see in the bottom black area a message that it has been installed.Â 
5. To verify they are properly installed, go to Sketch > Include Library menu. You should now see the library at the bottom of the drop-down menu.

*For more details or other ways to [install libraries, visit this link](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)Â 

## Examples:

You can find codes in File > Examples > OttoDIYLib.

* `Otto_allmoves.ino` great code for testing all dance movements, sounds and gestures.
* `Otto_APP.ino` this code is meant to work with the Bluetooth mobile app and module.
* `Otto_touchmodes.ino` use a touch sensor or button to demo multiple modes.
* `Otto_avoid.ino` uses the ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles.
* `Otto_CalibrationWalk.ino` simple calibration for the servos.
* `Otto_happybirthday.ino` plays a melody.

* `Otto_singleladies.ino` dance according to the song.
* `Otto_smoothcriminal.ino` dance according to the song.
* `Otto_testSensor.ino` reads data from any analog sensor.
* `Otto_photoresistor.ino` test light sensor.

## Library Structure

Base set of libraries for any biped robot that uses 4 motors in the legs, like Otto.

* `Otto.h` and `Otto.cpp` contain all the main functions.
* `Otto_gestures.h` contain all the gesture functions.
* `Otto_mouths.h` contains all the mouth functions.
* `Otto_sounds.h` contains all the sound functions.
* `Otto_matrix.h` contains all the matrix functions.
* `Oscillator.h` is the main algorithm for the servo's "smooth" movement.
* `SerialCommand.c` is for Bluetooth communication via software serial

### Adding libraries

```cpp
#include <Otto.h>
Otto Otto;
```

### Pins declaration

These are the default signal connections for the servos and buzzer for AVR Arduino boards in the examples, you can alternatively connect them to different pins if you also change the pin number.

```cpp
#define LeftLeg 2 // left leg pin
#define RightLeg 3 // right leg pin
#define LeftFoot 4 // left foot pin
#define RightFoot 5 // right foot pin
#define Buzzer 13 //buzzer pin
```

### Initialization

When starting the program, the 'init' function must be called with the use of servo motor calibration as a parameter. <br/>
It is best to place the servo motors in their home position after initialization with the 'home' function.

```cpp
void setup() {
   Otto.init(LeftLeg, RightLeg, LeftFoot, RightFoot, true, Buzzer);
   Otto.home();
}
```
The `home()` function makes the servos move to the center position, with Otto standing in the neutral position.

## Predetermined Functions:
Many preconfigured movements are available in the library:

### Movements:
These are actions that involve the use of the 4 servo motors with the oscillation library combined in synergy and with smooth movements. You can change the values inside the pratensis `()` to alter the speed, direction, and size of the movements.

#### Walk function

```cpp
Otto.walk(steps, time, dir);
```
- `steps` are just how many times you want to repeat that movement without the need for further coding or adding additional rows.
- `time` (noted as `T` below) translated in milliseconds is the duration of the movement. A higher time value slows the movement; try values ranging from 500 to 3000.
- `dir` is the direction: `1` for forward or `-1` backward

Example:
```cpp
Otto.walk(2, 1000, 1);
```
In this example, `2` is the number of steps, `1000` is "TIME" in milliseconds, and it will walk forward.

Try changing T value: Slow=2000 Normal=1000 Fast= 500

```cpp
Otto.turn(steps, T, dir);
```
(# of steps, T, to the left or -1 to the right)

```cpp
Otto.bend (steps, T, dir);
```

(# of steps, T, 1 bends to the left or -1 to the right)

```cpp
Otto.shakeLeg (steps, T, dir);
```
(# of steps, T, 1 bends to the left or -1 to the right)

```cpp
Otto.jump(steps, T);
```
(# of steps up, T) This one does not have a dir parameter.
Otto doesn't really jump. ðŸ˜œ

### Dances:

Similar to movements but more fun! You can adjust the new parameter `h` "height or size of the movements" to make the dance more interesting.

```cpp
Otto.moonwalker(steps, T, h, dir);
```
(# of steps, T, h, 1 to the left or -1 to the right)

`h`: Try changing between 15 and 40.


Example:
```cpp
Otto.moonwalker(3, 1000, 25,1);
```

```cpp
Otto.crusaito(steps, T, h, dir);
```
(# of steps, T, h, 1 to the left or -1 to the right)

`h`: Try changing between 20 and 50.

```cpp
Otto.flapping(steps, T, h, dir);
```
(# of steps, T, h, 1 to the front or -1 to the back)

`h`: Try changing between 10 and 30.

```cpp
Otto.swing(steps, T, h);
```
`h`: Try changing between 0 and 50.

```cpp
Otto.tiptoeSwing(steps, T, h);
```
`h`: Try changing between 0 and 50.

```cpp
Otto.jitter(steps, T, h);
```
`h`: Try changing between 5 and 25.

```cpp
Otto.updown(steps, T, h);  
```
`h`: Try changing between 0 and 90.

```cpp
Otto.ascendingTurn(steps, T, h);
```
`h`: Try changing between 5 and 15.

### Sounds:

```
Otto.sing(songName);
```
By just changing what is inside the () we can change the sounds easily to 19 different ones.
It's as simple as copying and pasting in a new row to make the sounds as many times as you like.

- S_connection
- S_disconnection
- S_buttonPushed
- S_mode1
- S_mode2
- S_mode3
- S_surprise
- S_OhOoh
- S_OhOoh2
- S_cuddly
- S_sleeping
- S_happy
- S_superHappy
- S_happy_short
- S_sad
- S_confused
- S_fart1
- S_fart2
- S_fart3

Otto can emit several sounds with the 'sing' function:
```cpp
Otto._tone(10, 3, 1);
```

(noteFrequency, noteDuration, silentDuration)

```cpp
Otto.bendTones (100, 200, 1.04, 10, 10);
```
(initFrequency, finalFrequency, prop, noteDuration, silentDuration)


### Gestures:
Finally, our favorite. This is a combination of the 2 previous functions we learned: sing + walk
Their goal is to express emotions by combining sounds with movements at the same time, and if you have the LED matrix, you can show them in the robot's mouth!

```cpp
Otto.playGesture(gesture);
```
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoHappy);`
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoSuperHappy);`
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoSad);`
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoVictory);`
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoAngry);`
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoSleeping);`
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoFretful);`
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoLove);`
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoConfused);`
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoFart);`
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoWave);`
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoMagic);`
- `Otto.playGesture(OttoFail);`

As you see, itâ€™s very simple, but what it does is quite advanced.
